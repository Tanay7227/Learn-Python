# Question:- Write a Program to input side of a square & Print its area.

# a = float(input("Enter Your Sides:- "))
# print ("Area of Square is:",a*a)

# # -----------or-----------
# a = float(input("Enter Your Sides:- "))

#Question:- WAP to input 2 floating point number & print their average.

# a = float(input("Enter Your First Number:"))
# b = float(input("Enter Your Second Number:"))
# print("Here is your Result:",(a+b)/2) # Brackets Solve First 

# '''As in given problem i get some knowlegde about brackets 
# a+b/2 answer is different
# (a+b)/2 answer is different because of brackets solve first
# it has more priority. So its Give Correct answer'''



# WAP to input 2 int numbers,a and b. Print True if a is greater than or equal to b. if not print false.

a = int(input("Enter a:"))
